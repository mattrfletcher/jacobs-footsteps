<h2>29th June 2015</h2>
    <p>A lot has happened in the last six months. Jacob went to another SDR party where he once agian met Dr Park and his physios, has been riding most weekends at Riding for the Disabled in Abingdon and also Jacob had another intense physiotherapy course at Mike Pool in Scotland at the beginning of April. Below is a summary of how that went:</p>
<blockquote>Jacob worked incredibly hard all week and had a great session. He is building confidence in independent standing and walking with his sticks. He has found a new love of walking in his walker and is getting very quick and cheeky with it!!!! Jacob is very proud of how far he has come- as we all are! He continues to keep pushing himself beyond what we ever thought would be possible and with the help of the Physio's and personal trainers in Oxford and Scotland he is progressing all the time! Thank you all for your continued support. </blockquote>

<h2> 27th June 2015</h2>

<p>Today marks two years since Jacob had his operation. It is hard to believe it's been 2 years since we were sat at St Louis Children's Hospital hopelessly waiting for our boy to come back from his life changing surgery. What an incredible journey and what amazing progress. From barely being able to stand with support to being able to walk every where in his walker and taking his first steps on his sticks. Completing his race at sports day, swimming fantastically and taking part in a Horse riding show tomorrow!! I have no doubt your going to improve so much more too. Keep up the incredible work boys. Very proud mummy of you both.</p>




<h2>31st December 2014</h2>
<p>Happy new year to you all. It's been another busy year with Physio and progress has been slow at times, despite all the hard work. But today just look at me standing strong and tall by myself. I managed to ride a normal trike along the sea front, walked on the beach just holding hands and climbed along the bridge at the park holding on all by myself, without a walker or wheelchair in sight. Here's to many 'firsts' in 2015! I think it's going to be my year  have a good one everybody and thanks for your continued support to make this all possible.</p>
<h2>18th December 2014<img src="images/djjacob.png" width="326" height="483" alt="Jacob doing his DJing"></h2>
<p>It was the boys christmas disco at school this afternoon and Jacob has been working on a very special goal for the event.</p>
<p>He is part of a new program in Oxfordshire called the Move Program which really focuses on bringing together goals set by the child and family to make everyday life a bit easier or achieving something the child really wants to do. It's a lovely idea to get the children motivated and to bring all the professionals together and to make sure they are listening to what the child wants to achieve not just doing Physio for the sake of it. So anyway, Jacob's goal was to be a DJ! Nothing too tricky then Jacob!
  <p>The school, Physio's and jacobs helpers all being so fabulous said they would arrange it for the end of term disco and in order to be able to achieve this he had to stand by himself only holding on with one hand (in order to be able to change songs with the other! ) to begin with he could only stand holding two hands for about 10 secs, after lots of work he got to one handed holding but very short sessions and by today he was able to hold the table with just one hand for 2 whole songs!!! It was an amazing moment, he had all his "fans" screaming for him and singing the words back to him! Jordan was leading the dancing with all the boys!</p>

<p>Wishing my little men a very happy end to their fantastic birthday weekend! They turned 6 on Friday! (Hard to believe!)They had a wonderful swimming party with 25 of their school friends and were spoilt rotten! Thank you so much for everyone that celebrated with us, gave presents and wished them a happy birthday! They are both doing fantastically in school and Jacob is still working very hard with his physio. He is working on independent standing with his Physio and also independent swimming. Amongst many other goals we have Progress is hard work but steady and were very proud of how Jacob always tries his best and always has a smile on his face </p>

<h2>15th August 2014</h2>
<p>Jacob has had his first session at Mike Poole Fitness in Scotland. Jacob was not able to stand for 1 second on his quad sticks before we visited. He can now stand and balance on them for 2 minutes! He has also taken his first ever independent steps on his quad sticks. It's only short distances and the steps are still wobbly. It's still a scary thing for him having never tried walking with such little support before, but with pratice the sky's the limit! The progress he has made in such a short time has been awesome. Thanks Mike and the team. </p>

<p>Jacob has been doing really well on his trike recently. He is now able to push off on his own and cycle in a straight line without any assistance even with Jordan riding on the back. He just needs some practice with his steering!</p>

<h2>29th March 2014 SDR party- 9 months post operation</h2>
<p>Just got to Daventry for the SDR party!! Seen Jacob's amazing surgeon Dr Park and his lovely Physio's Jackie and Mad Mike!! So exciting and to see all our friends and lovely families.</p>
<p>Jacob danced all night in his walker with his friends. This would never have been possible this time last year. Boys were so excited to see Dr Park and his amazing team. Best Mother's Day present ever, thank you all for making this possible.</p>

<h2>12th February</h2>
<p>Went upstairs to run the boys a bath, came back down and Jacob has got off the sofa by himself crawled over to the toy box, chosen two cars and started playing with them. </p>
<h2>30th January</h2>
<p>Great swimming session tonight. Jordan can now swim underwater and is getting so confident is the pool and Jacob has just learnt to swim with just his arm bands on with no help at all. Jordan said "Jacob that's awesome!" When he saw him! Amazing to see him doing something totally independently with no medical equipment anywhere in sight. Thanks to our lovely physio Jen for all her help getting him to this stage!</p>
<h2>7th January 2014 - 6 months post operation</h2>
<p>Supposed to start our 3 weeks intensive physio at Footsteps today but Jacob has been poorly this weekend so it's a day off today. Hopefully he will be back to his usual happy self by tomorrow. Looking forward to seeing what improvements he will make, as this will be his first intensive session at Footsteps since SDR. </p>
<p>A  red Tomcat trike has been ordered for Jacob which he is very excited about! It will be great to help strengthen his legs and give him more freedom. Motability have allowed us to change our car early for a bigger one so we will be able to fit all Jacobs equipment in much easier now. Funnily enough the bike is going to take longer to be built than the car! We are sending videos off to America in the next few days for his 6 month assessment so it will be interesting to get some feedback from them! Jacob is still extremely busy with swimming, horse riding and daily physio at school and at home and working hard as always.  Jordan is getting on very well at school and is now playing football and basketball for the school! Very proud of them both! Lets see what 2014 brings us! Xx</p>
<h2>10th November 2013</h2>
<p>We are holding a thank you party for all you lovely people that helped us to fundraise for Jacob's operation. Its on sat 16th Nov at 1pm at the White Hart in Eynsham. Please come along and  see Jacob. </p>
<h2>28th October 2013</h2>
<p>4 months post op! So we are now into half term. Can't believe how quickly the time has gone. The boys have been doing brilliantly at school and are really enjoying being there. After being pretty knocked out by a cold for the last few days, Jacob has been a bit tired and not been up to doing too much. So last night I told him that if he can crawl across the rug then I will buy him a new cd, hoping this might motivate him, (He hasn't done any independent crawling since the op, and even before the op it was very minimal and a big struggle) he got upset last night and said he can't do it and it's hard. I felt pretty bad for trying to get him to do it as I know crawling is one of the most difficult things for him, so I just promised to help him and reassured him that it would take time but with practice he will get there. </p>
<p>Anyway, he must have thought about it because this morning he woke up and said "I'm going to crawl now Mummy I want my cd" and sure enough he crawled right across the rug! He was so pleased. He then had physio first thing and I was unsure whether to take his wheelchair or see how far we could get walking. Jordan promised to help if Jacob got tired so we left the chair in the car. He walked all the way from the car park, into the hospital, up in the lift and into community paediatrics. By far the longest walk he's ever done in one go! Followed by a fabulous physio session! We then stopped in the cafe and a lovely couple said how well behaved they were, gave them some pocket money each and bought us all a bar of chocolate! Jacob still had energy and so walked all the way back to the car! <br>
  <br>
  We then of course went straight into town to get his promised cd, (He chose pop party 12) and Jordan chose a toy bus for being a fab boy all day. Whilst Nanny and Great Grandma were visiting Jacob wanted to show off his new crawling skills and even managed to get into the crawling position himself! Something never done before! <br>
  <br>
  All in all a fantastic day just time for swimming therapy now before bed.</p>

  <h2>Tuesday 17th September 2013  </h2>
  <p>Even better news, Jacob walked out of school today. He had the stamina to do a full school day and then he asked his teachers if he could walk out like the other children! Rather than me having to go into the class and push him in his wheelchair, he was able to walk straight out when his name was called all the way to the car.</p>
<h2>Monday 16th September 2013</h2>
<p>As promised photos of Jacob and Jordan walking into school! Jacob would have never even been able to walk around school before, let alone walk outside into school as well. Thank you so much to all who donated and help to fundraise. You've made one little boys dream come true and I'm one very proud mummy. </p>

<p>So Jacob and Jordan have completed their first week at "big boy school"! They have done fantastically well and settled in surprisingly easily. Jacob has been doing lots of walking and they have both learnt some German! Needless to say they are exhausted now! Mummy has also started on her studies to become a paediatric nurse! So all in all a busy week!</p>

<p>Great day for Jacob. He has done so much walking today! That ankle thankfully isn't bothering him anymore! <br>
  <br>
  Indoor play area with our friends this morning and he did loads of lovely walking everywhere, followed by a trip to the park this afternoon where he wanted to do even more walking! <br>
  <br>
  One big change in him is that he doesn't just fall flat on his face and let go of his walker if he gets tired. Instead he stays holding on and just goes onto his knees! He calls this his "silly walking"! </p>
<h2>Monday 5th August 2013</h2>
<p>Huge set back, poor Jacob has hurt his foot again at the weekend. Not sure what happened but now he won't weight bear on it so he is limping about and won't use his walker. Really hope this gets better soon as it is going to really set him back. Footsteps this morning too and we so wanted to show of his amazing improvements. We are gutted. Just hoping it heals quickly and we can avoid long hospital visits.</p>

<p>Well that's it, another chapter in our lives has ended, <br>
  <br>
  5 weeks, 4 flights, several thousand miles, 2 life changing surgeries, 100's of unbelievable first steps, and many wonderful friends. <br>
  <br>
  Best wishes to all the families we have met and huge thank you's to all who helped to make Jacobs dream a reality. <br>
  <br>
  Jacob still has lots of hard work to do and each day he will continue to improve and get stronger. We can't wait to see what the future holds.</p>

<h2>Sunday 21st July 2013</h2>
<p>Three weeks post operation and look at me go! It has always been my dream to see this happen.<br>
  <br>
  Jacob walked all the way from our room on the 2nd floor, right down the corridor, up in the lift, and all the way down the second corridor to Nanny and Grampy's room! Which must be about 100m! <br>
  <br>
  He would never in a million years have done this before surgery! He would barely take one step in that walker before!<br>
  <br>
  He loved it and he got so fast towards the end! He wasn't tip toeing or crossing his feet like he used to! <br>
  <br>
  Of course 'physio' Jordan was the inspiration as usual!</p>

<p>Poor Jacob with his red eyes! No fussing though! Looks really sore but there's no more squinting and he seems to be seeing great! He said "it looks different when I look down- I can see" ! And he's been counting his fingers!<br>
  <br>
  He was a bit tired today from the operation, but he still went to Physio this morning and did really well. He did some great core work, leg press and walking in his frame! Jacob did about 5 unaided steps in his walker with physio 'Mad Mike'!<br>
  <br>
  This afternoon he had a little nap and did 11 unaided steps in his walker so pleased and proud! If he does this well the day after surgery he'll be racing around in no time!</p>

<h2>Thursday 18th July 2013<img src="images/eyeoperation.png" width="240" height="320" alt="jacob before his eye operation"></h2>
<p>Surgery is scheduled for around 4/5 pm US time so (10/11pm UK time) will let you know how we get on, please keep your fingers crossed for Jacob again. Really appreciated all the support and we hope it will make a big difference to him.</p>
<p>Jacobs back at the hotel now. All went well, he is very tired. He can't see much until tomorrow which was a bit frightening for him and his eyes are very red. This is all perfectly normal after surgery though and to be expected. He is in no pain and he should be able to see perfectly fine again in the morning. He just needs some rest. We are all a bit physically and emotionally drained. Very glad it's over.<br>
  <br>
  Thanks all for your kind words.<br>
  <br>
  Brave little solider as always. Very proud xxxx</p>

<h2>Wednesday 17th July 2013<img src="images/JacobandJordanwc.png" width="230" height="317" alt="Jacob in wheelchair with jordan"></h2>
<p>So, Jacob is still working extremely hard at his Physio and stretches every day. He is using his walker with just me me holding his t-shirt now (for confidence) I cant wait to post a video of him walking in his walker totally on his own soon! <br>
  <br>
  We had an appointment with ophthalmology yesterday to check out his eyes and squint. Fabulous news is that he doesn't need glasses, his vision is actually good and they are not making any difference! (No more replacing glasses every week or so!)</p>
<p>He does however need surgery to correct his squint in both eyes. His muscles are too tight and are pulling his eyes in and up, which is resulting in him seeing double a lot of the time, particularly when he looks down. This means his fine motor skills are being really effected, as it very difficult for him to see what he is doing and it is also affecting his sitting and posture all things which are very difficult for him anyway! I wish we had known how much it is affecting him sooner, but anyway it looks like surgery will hopefully be scheduled for Thursday. It's worrying that he needs to be put to sleep again but compared to SDR it is fairly minor surgery. Should take about 45 mins and he should be out the same day. Will let you know exactly what day and time when we do, but hopefully it will make a huge difference to him again. <br>
  <br>
  On another note, another massive achievement for Jacob, he was swimming around the pool in a rubber ring totally by himself! He could support himself up and his little legs were going so fast! Will try and post a video tomorrow. Both boys were very excited to be able to swim about by themselves and we are very proud of them. </p>
<h2>Friday 12th July 2013<img src="images/splints.png" width="400" height="320" alt="jacobs splints"></h2>
<p>Jacob got to go swimming today for the first time since the operation and he loved it! He has been desperate to get back in the pool! </p>
<p>His kicking is so much better, he now kicks alternating his legs rather than just extending them out at the same time. <br>
  <br>
  Oh and guess how many steps we got to on the treadmill today..80! He literally walked until he dropped! Double what he managed 2 days ago! <br>
  <br>
  Hope you like the pics of the new (very American) splints!! Shoe shopping for the boys tomorrow as they now don't fit over the new splints!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>New shoes and our lovely build-a-bears! Big thank you to Sybil for giving us some pocket money for our lovely new bear and dog! We had such fun making the bears, choosing their shoes and outfits! </p>
<p>Physio was a bit slow today, think Jacob was a bit sleepy! Hopefully the weekend off will help and he will be back to full steam on Monday!</p>

<h2>Tuesday 9th July 2013</h2>
<p>Nanny and Grampy have now arrived and Jacob was definitely showing off for Nanny in physio! He did some fabulous walking again and Jackie his therapist says he is very close to walking in his walker by himself! Once he gets his new splints this will help him even more. He was well and truly ready for bed tonight with all that hard work and asked to go up to cuddle his elephant! Jordan in the meantime is taking trunki (his suitcase) for a walk as he says "he wants to come down, he's been stuck up in his room for weeks!</p>
<p>Jacob has had his second go on the treadmill and there are already huge improvements! 40 steps today and barely any support from the physio let's get to 100 by the end of the week</p>

<p>Jacob's first go on a treadmill! Great work with one of the physios 'Mad Mike'.  <br>
  <br>
  He did some fabulous walking in his walker and went on the leg press too! He's really getting that strength back and more!</p>
<h2>Saturday 6th July 2013</h2>
<p>Another great day for Jacob. He is so much stronger today. We are borrowing a walker until Jacobs own one arrives and it's great. A much better fit and the swivel wheels are so much easier to steer! Main improvement I have noticed today is his new found ability to side step! This was very difficult for him to bring his legs apart before and now it's very easy.

</h2>
<p>Jacob had his first go in his walker since SDR, he did amazingly well. No more crossing his legs or tip toes and this is with no splints on. Physio said she was giving him minimal support at the hips and is really impressed with how strong he is already. Can finally see how tall he is. <br>
  <br>
  Also we have ordered a new walker as this one is too small, and Jacob has chosen flames to go on it. He should get new splints soon too. He has chosen American flags for his day time splints with dogs on the straps and we allowed him to have pink ones for his night time splints as he was desperate to have pink (his favourite colour).</p>

<h2>Tuesday 2nd July 2013 - Day 5 Post Operation<img src="images/bruvpad.png" width="410" height="307" alt="jacob and jordan with Ipad"></h2>
<p>He was discharged from the hospital today so it has been "home sweet home" (well our temporary home anyway). Today has been a great day!  and Jacob was so excited to be out and back in the hotel. We even got to stop and see Sadie the therapy dog on the way out which he loved. She was beautiful and so gentle with him. <br>
  <br>
  He did really well in physio. He managed to catch a large ball several times, I have never seen him catch a ball before. He kept looking at his new open hand in amazement.<br>
  <br>
  He is able to roll independently again and even did a little bit of army crawling by himself. He sat on a bench unaided too.   <br>
  <br>
  He had a little nap this afternoon while mummy got to go swimming with Jordan.  <br>
  <br>
  He is now playing on the iPad with "my brover"  they are very happy to be back together. (Even though they were arguing about who was the cutest in the car home.)    <br>
  <br>
  Massive thanks to all the nurses at St Louis Childrens Hospital, they were all totally amazing. Little man is now know as Mr Jacob and is defiantly sounding more American by the day!!! Xxx</p>
<h2>Monday 1st July 2013 - Day 4 Post Operation<img src="images/jacobsadie.png" width="420" height="317" alt="jacob with sadie "></h2>
<p>It was a much better day today. Jacob did really well in both physio sessions and is eating for England again. Pizza and fries are on their way and he can't wait!<br>
  <br>
  He did a lot of rolling today and some crawling practice. It is really hard work for him at the moment but he's trying very hard and the physio said after he had been doing it for a little while he needed less support. Same with sit to stand, he got stronger after doing a couple of reps which is great. <br>
  <br>
  He is brilliant at his stretches and seems to be using his legs separately for the first time. You can see his brain ticking away and making new connections.<br>
  <br>
  He did a couple of exercises that he couldn't do before too which is amazing (lying on his tummy and lifting legs one at a time to kick his bottom) seems simple but he couldn't do them before as his brain was just sending mixed messages to his legs so it's great to see this has improved! <br>
  <br>
  He even got to ride a trike around the therapy centre today but his steering needs a little more practice.<br>
  <br>
  Had a bit of an 'oh my god I can't believe he has actually had SDR' moment today. Reality kind of caught up with me but it feels good.<br>
  <br>
  Thanks everyone for your continued support. Night all xxx</p>

<h2>Sunday 30th June 2013 - Day 3 Post Operation<img src="images/physiocrawl.jpg" width="313" height="324" alt="jacob crawling at physio"></h2>
<p>It started off pretty rough. Jacob was still being sick and he is just exhausted. Really has no energy since he hasn't eaten really since Thursday and anything he does eat he's not holding it down. Felt pretty sad about it all this morning. He got up in his wheelchair for the first time briefly but was very floppy and tired and as soon as he got back in to bed he was flat out for hours. <br>
  <br>
  This afternoon's physio was much better. He managed one little biscuit just before physio. He started off very sleepy but going to a different room in the hospital really perked him up. His beautiful smile came back and he was more chatty again. <br>
  <br>
  Despite yawning all the way through physio, he tolerated it very well. There was no pain and he managed some rolling, independent sitting and crawling with a bit of support.<br>
  <br>
  Back up to the room and he had some pediasure but couldn't keep it down again and now he's sleeping. <br>
  <br>
  We're allowed to take him for a ride in his wheelchair about 6pm so I'm going to show him the beautiful rooftop garden which should cheer him up! <br>
  <br>
  Keep your fingers crossed for the sickness to stop and for tomorrow to be even better.<br>
  <br>
  Thanks for all your support xxx</p>

<h2>Saturday 29th June 2013 - Day 2 Post Operation</h2>
<p>It was a a good night last night. We both got a bit more sleep. He's been feeling a bit sick this morning poor thing but still being a little angel. He's looking forward to tomorrow to get all his wires out and he gets to sit up for the first time. His little toes are still wiggling,  first time I've seen them do that!</p>
<h2>Friday 28th June 2013 - Day 1	Post Operation</h2>
<p>Jacob had a great night with no pain or fussing at all. Just charming all the nurses! We didn't get much sleep due to doctors and nurses checking up on him and changing medications every hour. This morning he has been a little bit sick but still doing great and not bothered by it. </p>

<h2>Thursday 27th June 2013<img src="images/jacobpenguin.jpg" width="240" height="320" alt="jacon with toy penguin"></h2>
<p>Jacob has had his operation! Everything went well and he is now on the ward. He has a lovely nurse and a nice room with a lovely view. He is being well looked after but is very sleepy as he is still recovering from the anesthetic. He will be in hospital for 5 days and will be feeling a bit sore for the next few days.</p>
<p>Jacob has been very good and really brave. He has his favourite cuddly toys with him Meg, Dumbo and a new Penguin friend.</p>
<p>Thanks to everone for all your kind words, thoughts and prayers for Jacob today. </p>

<h2>Tuesday 25th June 2013<img src="images/jacobdrpark.jpg" width="240" height="320" alt="jacob with Dr Park"></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jacob had his pre op assesment yesterday and met Dr Park. He thinks SDR will really help Jacob. He will experience better sitting, better crawling, no more spasticity in his legs and no more scissoring. It will help improve his range of movements in his arms and he thinks he'll be quick and independent in his walker fairly soon after the operation. He thinks he will be using cane sticks within a year and he has a chance of independent walking too. They will be able to give us better predictions after the operation.</p>
<p>We are scheduled for surgery at 5.45 am US time ( 11.45 am UK Time) on Thursday 27th June.</p>

<p>Lucy &amp; family have arrived safely in St Louis after a very long journey! The boys were very good on the flight and are excited to be in America!</p>
<p>Jacob has his first appointment at the hospital with Dr. Park tomorrow (Monday). His operation is planned for Thursday 27th June.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>16th June 2013</h2>
<p>We are very pleased to say that we have exceeded our fundraising target and we are now preparing and packing to go to America in the next few days!</p>
<p>We would like to say a massive thank you to everybody who has donated and helped us with our fundraising. We are totally overwhelmed by the generosity that has been shown to us. Without your help Jacob wouldn't have this amazing chance of a better life and the opportunity to walk independently. </p>
<p>We will keep you updated of his progress over the next few weeks here on the website or on the Facebook page.</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

<h2>7th January 2013 - Footsteps Physiotherapy Course</h2>
<p>Jacob has just started another three week course at Footsteps. He is progressing very well and he is doing things that he has never been able to do before!</p>
<h2>10th December 2012 - Operation Acceptance!</h2>
<p>We have just had the most amazing news in the world! Jacob has been accepted for the SDR operation at St. Louis Children's Hospital with Dr Park. He has predicted that he will walk with crutches and also should achieve some independent walking as a result of the operation. He feels that Jacob is an excellent candidate for the operation and will benefit greatly from it. A date for the operation is yet to be confirmed. More details to follow.</p>
<h2>7th December 2012- Nursery Sale</h2>
<p>Many thanks to the staff at the Grandpont Nursery, Oxford <br> 
for letting us hold a sale.
We made an amazing £242.00!<br>

<h2>30th November 2012 - David Cameron Meeting<img src="images/dcmeeting.JPG" alt="The family with David Cameron" width="461" height="345"></h2>
<p>We had a very important meeting tonight with David Cameron to discuss SDR. Our aim was to raise more awareness of this life changing operation and to question and challenge why it is not funded for every suitable child on the NHS. It was a very positive meeting and we look forward to seeing what impact it may have. Hopefully we will start to see some changes with more funding and more awareness and positivity amongst the professionals. Even if it is too late to make a difference for Jacob, it should hopefully raise awareness of the importance of SDR and get the ball rolling for future SDR candidates.</p>

<h2>24th November 2012</h2>
<p>We held our first fundraising event, a bric-a-brac and Christmas gift sale, at St Leonards Church Hall, Eynsham and raised £153.00. Many thanks to everyone that has supported us.</p>
<h2>28th Ocober 2012</h2>
<p>We are now starting to do some fundraising activities. Details of these can be found on the Fundrasiing page.</p>
<h2>21st October 2012</h2>
<p>We have now raised the first £1,000 pounds. A big thank you to everyone that has donated so far.</p>
<h2>15th October 2012</h2>
<p>Jacob had his botox injections today and this has helped him a lot. This is only a <br>
  temporary solution and only lasts for about 3 months at a time. <br>
  This is why he needs the SDR operation to give him permanent relief.</p>
<h2>21st September 2012</h2>
<p> So far we have raised £293.00!! Thanks to all of you that have very kindly donated so far.
  

<h2>20th September 2012</h2>
