<h1> About Jacob</h1>

<section class="message">

<p>Hi, my name is Jacob, I am 7 years old and I have cerebral palsy. I have a twin brother called Jordan. We are the best of friends and it is Jordan’s and my biggest wish for me to be able to walk independently, so that one day we can play together. </p>

<p>In July 2013 I had to travel to St Louis Children’s Hospital in America to have a major operation called SDR (Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy). This was privately funded with the help and generosity of many people. Having this operation has significantly improved my life for the better and has greatly improved my mobility. I am now able to walk independently on my quad sticks, ride a bike, sit comfortably, swim, and ride a horse, just to name a few things! </p>

<p>However, this has taken 3 years of intensive therapy and hard work to get me to this stage. The operation unlocked the door to give me a whole new life but it is up to me and continuing the therapy and hard work that is going to allow me to walk through it!</p>

<p>I have been attending regular private physiotherapy sessions, and travelling many miles to Walk This Way UK' in Scotland for many blocks of intensive training. It is this coaching that has been life changing for me and allowed me to progress as much as I have. I am doing so well, but in order for this to continue we must carry on with the therapy. I will also need corrective orthopedic surgery in the near future to release the tendons in my legs which are tight. Obviously this costs a lot of money and we would be most grateful for your help to keep me on my feet.</p>

<p>We are going to be doing lots of fun and interesting fundraising events to help raise the money to help Jacob over the next 3 years, which we anticipate will cost about £45,000 in total.</p>

<section class="information">


<h2> Jacob's Condition </h2>

  <p>Jacob has cerebral  palsy which means that he experiences stiffness or spasticity in his muscles  and has difficulties with his mobility and co-ordination.  This condition was caused by damage to the  brain either before, during or shortly after birth.<br>
  Some children with  cerebral palsy also have difficulties with talking, eating, hearing and sight  but luckily Jacob is not affected in these areas, only with his mobility.</p>

<h2>Jacob's Treatment - Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy </h2>

<p>We have discovered that  there is a treatment available that could help Jacob which is called Selective  Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR).  The treatment is  available in the U.S.A and has been performed on many children over the last 20  years with life changing results.  The  procedure has just started to be performed in this country at Frenchay Hospital  in Bristol but it is not yet widely available in this country.<br>
  The operation involves  cutting the faulty nerve roots in the spinal cord so that they cannot cause the  muscles to stiffen and cause the spasticity.   It is a major operation and involves intensive physiotherapy afterwards  to achieve the best results.  However, we  have heard so many stories of children having this operation and then being  able to do things that they couldn&rsquo;t do before such as crawling and walking  independently that we think that Jacob should be given the chance to have this  life-changing operation too.</p>
